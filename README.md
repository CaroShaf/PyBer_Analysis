# PyBer Analysis
V. Izualize asked for additional data analysis on the number of drivers, average fares in three different types of cities: Urban, Suburban and Rural.  She asked for a data summary as well as a line chart of weekly fares by city types.

## Overview of the analysis
Looking at a data summary as well as a line chart of the three different types of cities gives the CEO information about where to invest resources to increase profits and expand services.

## Results
From the data, it is clear that fewer drivers are needed in rural areas, but the fares are higher as a result of less competition.

## Summary
A recommendation would be to study the distance from rural areas to suburban or urban areas to see if drivers from these areas may be able to increase their service area and increase the number of riders utilizing the service at higher fares.  This could not only be a benefit to people in rural areas, but could potentially create more income for drivers that are staying in urban areas and receiving lower fares.  The cost analysis would have to be weighed in order to determine if a greater number of rides at a lower fare would be more profitable to the driver than fewer riders at a higher fare.  It would also be beneficial to study rides in relationship to attractions such as shopping areas, and hospitals.  The day of week is relevant as well.  It may be beneficial to have higher number of drivers on higher traffic days and reduce number of drivers for lower traffic.
